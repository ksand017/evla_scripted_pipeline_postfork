-Changed importevla to importasdm
-The important xml files such as Flag.xml, Antenna.xml, SpectralWindow.xml are not being copied to the
ms using importasdm from the sdm to the ms. Added the copying commands to do so.

-Set outfile='onlineFlags.txt' in importasdm

EVLA_pipe_msinfo.py
-Added the option to make logarithmic antenna positions plot.
-changed 'xml' to 'list' in the flagcmd execution to make the online flags plot using the file onlineFlags.txt
made by importasdm

-To reduce the dependance on the Flag.xml, changed inpmode to 'list' in flagcmd to apply the online flags using
the file onlineFlags.txt made by importasdm

not done by using the file onlineFlags.txt made by importasdm instead of the Flag.xml file
