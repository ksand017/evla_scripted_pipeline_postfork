EVLA Scripted Pipeline
======================
Welcome to the EVLA Scripted Pipeline documentation. This site contains usage
and API documentation for the scripted pipeline.

The scripted pipeline was used for basic calibration of VLA Stokes I continuum
data up until September, 2015, at which point operations transitioned to the
`Integrated Pipeline <https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/data-processing/pipeline/>`.
The original documentation for scripted pipeline may be found
`here <https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/data-processing/pipeline/scripted-pipeline>`
and was valid for CASA up to version v5.3.0.


Help and Contributing
=====================
If you run into an issue, please report it on the
`issue tracker <https://gitlab.nrao.edu/bsvoboda/evla-scripted-pipeline/-/issues>`_
or email ``bsvoboda@nrao.edu``. The scripted pipeline is currently maintained
on a best-effort basis, but we are happy to assist. Contributions are welcome.
